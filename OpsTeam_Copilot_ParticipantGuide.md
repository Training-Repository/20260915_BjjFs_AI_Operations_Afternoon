# M365 Copilot Prompt Guide
## Operations Team — 5 Workplace Use Cases
**Program: GenAI for Enterprise Teams | Technizer Edge**
**Tool: M365 Copilot Chat (microsoft365.com/chat)**

## How to Use This Guide

This guide gives you ready-to-use prompts for five real operations tasks. Each use case follows a simple two-step approach:

**Step 1 — Generate your prompt** using the Meta Prompt Framework
**Step 2 — Apply it live** by attaching your Excel file and running the generated prompt

You don't need to write prompts from scratch. The Meta Prompt does that for you.

---

## The RTCFT Prompt Framework

Use this template whenever you want Copilot to write a high-quality prompt for any task:

```
Act as a Microsoft Copilot prompt expert.

Role:    I am a [YOUR JOB TITLE] in [YOUR TEAM/DEPARTMENT].
Task:    I need to [WHAT YOU WANT TO DO].
Context: My data is in [FILENAME]. The relevant sheet is [SHEET NAME].
Format:  The output should be [table / bullet points / email / report].
Tone:    The tone should be [formal / concise / executive-level / action-oriented].

Write me a detailed, ready-to-use Copilot prompt I can apply directly.
```

> **Remember:** After Copilot generates your working prompt, attach your Excel file using `/` in Copilot Chat — then paste and run the generated prompt.

---

## Dataset: What's in Your Excel File

| Sheet | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| **SOP Register** | 12 SOPs with owner, version, review dates, and compliance risk |
| **Incident Log** | 12 operational incidents with severity, root cause, and resolution details |
| **Ops Performance Report** | Monthly KPIs: SLA, first-time-right %, error rate, complaints |
| **Workflow Analysis** | 12 processes with cycle times, manual steps, bottlenecks, automation potential |
| **Stakeholder Comms Log** | 10 internal communications with audience, action required, and status |

**File name:** `OpsTeam_Copilot_Training_Dataset.xlsx`

---

## Use Case 1 — SOP Creation and Documentation

**Scenario:** Your team manages SOPs across multiple functions. Some are overdue for review. Use Copilot to identify gaps and prioritise action.

---

### Step 1 — Paste this Meta Prompt into Copilot Chat

```
Act as a Microsoft Copilot prompt expert.

Role:    I am an Operations Manager responsible for process governance.
Task:    I need to analyse our SOP Register, identify which SOPs are overdue for review,
         and generate a summary table with recommended actions.
Context: My data is in OpsTeam_Copilot_Training_Dataset.xlsx, sheet: SOP Register.
         Columns: SOP ID, Process Name, Department, Owner, Version,
         Last Reviewed, Review Due, Status, Compliance Risk.
Format:  A structured table showing overdue SOPs sorted by Compliance Risk (Critical first),
         followed by 3 bullet-point action recommendations.
Tone:    Formal and action-oriented — suitable for sharing with the Head of Compliance.

Write me a detailed, ready-to-use Copilot prompt I can apply directly to this file.
```

---

### Step 2 — Attach the Excel file using `/`, then paste this Working Prompt

```
I am an Operations Manager reviewing our SOP compliance status.

Analyse the SOP Register sheet in the attached file. Identify all SOPs where:
- Status is "Overdue" or "Under Review"
- Review Due date has passed or is within 30 days

Present findings in a table with columns:
SOP ID | Process Name | Owner | Compliance Risk | Status | Days Overdue | Recommended Action

Sort by Compliance Risk (Critical → High → Medium → Low).
After the table, provide 3 concise action recommendations for the Ops Head.
Use formal, compliance-ready language.
```

---

### Try It Yourself

Adapt this for your own SOPs by changing the role, the sheet name, and the compliance risk threshold. Try asking Copilot to also draft a reminder email to overdue SOP owners.

---

## Use Case 2 — Incident Analysis

**Scenario:** Your team logged 12 incidents in Q1. Leadership wants a root cause summary and corrective action recommendations before the Risk Committee meeting.

---

### Step 1 — Paste this Meta Prompt into Copilot Chat

```
Act as a Microsoft Copilot prompt expert.

Role:    I am an Operational Risk Analyst preparing a quarterly incident review.
Task:    I need to analyse Q1 FY2026-27 operational incidents, identify recurring root
         cause categories, and highlight the top 3 systemic issues needing process fixes.
Context: My data is in OpsTeam_Copilot_Training_Dataset.xlsx, sheet: Incident Log.
         Columns: Incident ID, Date, Process Affected, Severity, Root Cause Category,
         Description, Downtime (hrs), Customers Impacted, Resolution Time (hrs),

## Bonus — Generate a New SOP from Scratch

You don't need existing data to get value from Copilot. Try this prompt directly in Copilot Chat or Word Copilot to generate a complete SOP template:

```
I am an Operations Manager at a financial services NBFC.

Draft a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for:
"Customer Grievance Redressal — Digital Channels"

Structure:
1. Purpose & Scope
2. Definitions
3. Roles and Responsibilities (table: Role | Responsibility | Escalation Authority)
4. Process Steps (numbered, with decision points noted)
5. TAT / SLA Requirements (table)
6. Escalation Matrix (3 levels)
7. Compliance & Regulatory Requirements (RBI reference placeholders)
8. Version Control Log

Use formal, RBI-compliant language. Keep each section concise but complete.
```

Adapt the process name to any SOP your team needs — onboarding, cash management, vendor approval, and so on.

## RTCFT at a Glance

| Letter | Stands For | What to Write |
|---|---|---|
| **R** | Role | Your job title — "I am an Ops Manager / Risk Analyst / Ops Lead…" |
| **T** | Task | What you need — "Analyse… / Draft… / Identify… / Summarise…" |
| **C** | Context | File name, sheet name, and key column names |
| **F** | Format | Table / bullet list / email / report / executive summary |
| **T** | Tone | Formal / concise / executive-level / action-oriented |

**Tip:** Always give Copilot the column names from your sheet. The more context you provide, the more precise and usable the output.

---

## Quick Answers

**Does Copilot read all sheets in the file?**
Yes — when you attach the file via `/`, Copilot can access all sheets. Always name the specific sheet in your prompt for accurate results.

**Can Copilot write back to my Excel file?**
Copilot Chat produces text output. Copy the table or text into your Excel file. In-app Excel Copilot can insert columns and formulas directly.

**Is my data secure?**
M365 Copilot operates within your organisation's Microsoft 365 tenant. Your data does not leave your environment.

**Can I use these prompts for my own data?**
Yes — replace the file name, sheet name, and column names with your actual data. The RTCFT framework works for any dataset or document.

**What if the output isn't quite right?**
Follow up with a refinement prompt: *"Make it shorter / more formal / add a column for priority / present as an email instead."* Copilot remembers the context of the conversation.
